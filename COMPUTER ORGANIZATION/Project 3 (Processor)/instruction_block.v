/*
Instruction memory should hold up to 1024 instructions where each instruction is 32-bits.
Thus, the least significant 10 bits of the jump addresses will be enough.
But you should fill the rest of the address block with zeros. For instance, jump instructionâ€™s address block (in machine 
code level) should be 26 bits even though you only use the least significant 10 bits.
